> existing soln + limitations
	- they are fragmented
	- they are paid
	- they depend on 3rd party (beeter to have indigenous tool for indian needs)
	- only identify addresses (we do all)
> our solution
	- 3 possible approaches
		- static analysis: false +ve
		- full node: expensive
		- light node: best of both worlds

we are developing custom light nodes for all cryptos. we have completed btc and are actively working on supporting the other netwoks. while we do this, we support all required actions and more using a hybrid of static analysis and public full nodes. 

	- innovation
		- defragmentation
		- supports 18? cryptos?
		- custom light nodes
		- cross platform
		- easy to deploy and low maintainance
		- verify from multiple sources
